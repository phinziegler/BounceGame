This is a work in progress.<br>
At this moment it is just a simple physics and render engine.

## To Do
1. Change all collisions to generic object collisions --- use active and passive objects and get rid of basic ground/wall/ceiling collisions
2. Make collision detection continuous.
2. Make friction be a function of deltaTime. (say for example, every second the ball should lose 10% of its velocity?)
