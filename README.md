This is a work in progress.
I don't even know what it will be yet, but it'll be something.

## To Do
1. Improve the impulse calculation to include the normal vector.
2. Rework the background object into a generic Background class, and change background.js into floor.js
4. Make the game an actual game.
5. ????
6. Profit.
